# Purple Template

## Installing

run this code if you want to create a new project using this template: 

```bash
quarto use template coe-test-org/purpledoc
```

This will install the extension and create an example qmd file that you can use as a starting place for your article.

## Using

This template is pretty bare for now, but it comes with custom images, highlight styles and css rules.

1. DOH and NW-PGCOE images
2. custom syntax highlighting
3. css rules
   - `myframe` will put a box shadow around your code block
   - `smallframe` is the same shawdow but for smaller code chunks
   - the title block headers come with a NW-PGCOE image as default

## Format Options

*TODO*: If your format has options that can be set via document metadata, describe them.

## Example

Here is the source code for a minimal sample document: [example.qmd](template.qmd).
Here's an example of the output https://coe-test-org.github.io/purpledoc/
