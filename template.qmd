## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

you can use a box shadow by calling the `myframe` css class

::: myframe
```{r filename="script_in_repo.R"}
#| eval: false
# this script is in the repo, but credentials are hidden
library(yaml)

# read in the local credentials yaml file
creds <- yaml::read_yaml("path/to/local_credentials.yml")

# pull in the credentials
server_name <- creds$default$conn_list_wdrs$server
```
:::

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
